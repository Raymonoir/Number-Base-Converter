# Number-Base-Converter

<h1>Background</h1>
My Fundemantals of Computing 1 & 2 modules in the first year of my computer science degree required me to be able to switch between number bases fluently. I wanted something to check my answers when translating to and from octal, binary and hexadecimal however I was on a short time frame so i was unable to implement number bases above 10.


<h1>Instructions</h1>
On running the window class you are greeted with a GUI in which you are able to input: <br>
Given Base: The base your number is in <br>
Wanted base: The base you want your number in <br>
Given Number: Your number <br>

Then simply click convert to see the result.


<h1> Possible additions </h1>
1. Add conversion to bases above 10
